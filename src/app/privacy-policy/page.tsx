          <Paragraph>Use of Cookies</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The WE LIVE 4 website may use &quot;cookies&quot; to help you
            personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is
            placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be
            used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies
            are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server
            in the domain that issued the cookie to you
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
            feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
            server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if
            you personalize WE LIVE 4 pages, or register with WE LIVE 4 site or
            services, a cookie helps WE LIVE 4 to recall your specific
            information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
            recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
            shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same WE LIVE 4
            website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
            so you can easily use the WE LIVE 4 features that you customized.
          </Paragraph>

            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
            browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
            decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
            interactive features of the WE LIVE 4 services or websites you
            visit.
