    text: "Anton was polite, professional, and got the job done. It was the installation of 3 Ethernet wall ports and the replacement of 1 phone jack into an Ethernet port. He cleaned up after himself & got rid of extra cabling upon request. There were to accidents in the process but the fixes for them are small & easy. Julia from sales also was very responsive & punctual. The immediacy of the job, what they accomplished, & for the price they did it added up to an overall great experience! Thanks!",
