      <Title>Can You Put a Regular TV Outside? 3 Features To Consider!</Title>
      <Description>
        Are you considering installing a television in your garden but unsure if
        you can use a regular TV outside? Concerned about spending more on an
        outdoor TV or choosing a regular TV with a cover to save money?
      </Description>
      <Description>
        This article compares both types of TV to answer the question “Can you
        put a regular TV outside?”. It also gives tips to help your investment
        last longer.
      </Description>
      <Title>Can You Put a Regular TV Outside?</Title>
      <Description>
        Technically, you can install a regular TV outside like any flat surface
        indoors, but experts do not recommend it. You should only use indoor TVs
        indoors. Using an indoor TV outside can cause damage to the TV over
        time.
      </Description>
      <Subtitle>Differences in Enclosure Materials</Subtitle>
      <Description>
        Manufacturers design indoor TVs for indoor environments with shaded
        areas, minimal direct sunlight, and dry conditions. They&apos;re made of
        common plastic or metal frames and enclosures to keep production costs
        down.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        In contrast, specialized outdoor televisions have sturdy designs built
        to withstand outdoor elements like water, dust, and weather. They
        feature robust, weatherproof enclosures made of durable materials such
        as aluminum or stainless steel.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Outdoor TVs are often certified with an IP rating. This score indicates
        their level of protection against dirt, moisture, and tampering.
        Standard ones usually have IP ratings above 54. Examples include Samsung
        The Terrace (IP55), SunBriteTV (IP65), Furrion Aurora (IP54),
        Séura (IP56), and more.
      </Description>
      <Subtitle>Differences in Resistance Features</Subtitle>
      <Description>
        Indoor TVs usually have cooling systems with open ventilation holes to
        let air flow in and out, helping to cool down the device. But, if these
        ventilation holes are placed in outdoor spaces, insects and dust can
        enter the TV&apos;s electronic circuits, causing damage.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        But, outdoor televisions like Séura or SunBriteTV are often equipped
        with sealed weatherproof enclosures and insect-resistant screen
        coatings. These features help repel insects, preventing them from
        landing or nesting on the TV&apos;s surface and ensuring better
        protection against damage.
      </Description>
      <Subtitle>Differences in Brightness Level</Subtitle>
      <Description>
        Finally, the brightness levels of both types also differ. Outdoor
        televisions, specialized for outside use, have higher brightness levels
        to optimize viewing for outdoor environments. In contrast, even if you
        adjust the brightness of a regular television to a higher level, it
        still may not be enough for viewing. This is because it can be washed
        out by direct sunlight, leading to potential overheating and damage. 
      </Description>
      <Description>
        About glare reduction, some outdoor TV models are also coated with an
        anti-glare and anti-reflective coating on their screens to cut glare and
        improve visibility.
      </Description>
      <Title>Do Outdoor TV Covers Work?</Title>
      <Description>
        TV covers can work if they&apos;re an extra protective layer for your
        television Yet, for regular TV outside, the cover may not protect them
        from moisture in the environment.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        A TV cover is a fabric cover (usually made of polyester) designed to
        wrap around the TV like a car cover. They can be good at keeping out
        dust because they&apos;re made to protect almost the entire outer
        surface of the television. Yet, some TVs are flush-mounted, making it
        difficult for the cover to cover their backside, which could still let
        moisture seep in.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Regular indoor TVs come with built-in cooling systems and ventilation
        ports to release heat while in use. If a cover is designed with
        ventilation holes that line up with or cover these ports on indoor
        televisions, it could disturb airflow and affect their cooling
        function. 
      </Description>
      <Description>
        But, if the ventilation holes of the TV cover are placed away from the
        television&apos;s built-in ventilation ports, or if indoor TVs
        don&apos;t depend on external airflow for cooling, this issue may not be
        a concern.
      </Description>
      <Title>How Long Will a TV Last Outside?</Title>
      <Description>
        For an indoor TV, its lifespan depends on various factors. In theory, if
        you find an ideal spot with a shelter that can block direct rain, it
        might last around a year. But, besides rain, other elements like morning
        humidity, insects, and bee nests could cause damage. Those elements
        could make the television last only about 6-7 months. Even with
        protective measures like TV covers or enclosures, it may only extend a
        few more months.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        But, durable outdoor TVs can last from 5 to 10 years or more, depending
        on conditions and care. With proper maintenance and protection, their
        lifespan could be extended further.
      </Description>
      <Title>Do You Need An Outdoor TV For Outside?</Title>
      <Description>
        Based on the above considerations, WE LIVE 4 recommends choosing a
        specialized outdoor television for your entertainment needs. These
        televisions are designed to withstand outdoor conditions, providing
        peace of mind without worrying about potential damage.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Outdoor TVs range in price from $1,500 to $10,000. Indoor televisions in
        the same category can cost anywhere from $500 to over $1,500. When
        considering the cost of protecting regular television, it&apos;s best to
        invest in a mid-range outdoor TV to save money. 
      </Description>
      <Description>
        This will be cost-effective in the long term compared to buying
        protective equipment like enclosures or covers.
      </Description>
      <Title>Do Outdoor TV Need To Be Covered?</Title>
      <Description>
        Outdoor TVs are made for outside use and come in different types:
        full-shade, partial-shade, and full-sun. They don&apos;t need extra
        protection when placed outside. Full-sun televisions are made for direct
        sunlight and are usually tougher against sun exposure, while the others
        are for shaded areas. They might be tougher than indoor TVs, but not as
        tough as full-sun ones.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        These televisions in direct sunlight do not need a cover. Yet,
        televisions in partial or full shade may enjoy one. This is especially
        true if they are exposed to a significant amount of sunlight or other
        hazards. Using a cover adds an extra shield, keeping the TV safe from
        various outside factors and ensuring it lasts longer.
      </Description>
      <Title>How To Protect a TV Outside?</Title>
      <Description>
        You&apos;ll find a range of weatherproof shield options available at
        different prices to safeguard your television. The most budget-friendly
        choice is the TV cover we discussed earlier. If your TV will be in a
        shelter or a dry area, a TV cover will protect it well. These covers are
        lightweight, easy to store, simple to remove, and much cheaper than
        other options.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Additionally, there are alternatives like TV enclosures or TV cabinets.
        These options offer features like weather-resistance and bug-resistance,
        but they do come at a higher cost than covers. Also, they may be a bit
        trickier to take apart compared to the cover.
      </Description>
      <Subtitle>Theft Protection</Subtitle>
      <Description>
        Aside from weather and other conditions, protecting your investment from
        thefts is crucial. Start by ensuring your television is mounted to a
        sturdy surface using tamper-resistant mounts or brackets. Choose a
        location that&apos;s not accessible to potential thieves, such as high
        on a wall or within a locked enclosure.

        Additionally, consider installing locking devices like security cables
        or enclosures to further deter unauthorized removal of the TV. These
        devices act as a barrier, preventing thieves from detaching the
        television from its mounting surface or stand. By implementing these
        strategies, you can help safeguard your television and enjoy peace of
        mind knowing it&apos;s protected against theft.
      </Description>
      <Subtitle>Regular Maintenance</Subtitle>
      <Description>
        To maintain the optimal condition of your outdoor TV, it is important to
        clean the screen and enclosure using a soft cloth and mild detergent to
        remove dust and debris without damaging the finish. 
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Take the time to inspect the television for signs of damage, such as
        cracks or water ingress, and pay close attention to seals and gaskets
        that may degrade over time. Ensure that all cables and connections are
        secure to prevent signal loss or power issues. 
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Keep ventilation ports clear of obstructions to prevent overheating and
        maintain optimal performance. In the event of any significant issues,
        consult a professional technician for inspection and repair.
